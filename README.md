When it came to this project we had to create a clock that displayed the time in 12hr and 24hr. With this, we had to figure out how to take the input of the users time and then write the code where they had the option to add a second, minute, or hour. When it came to write this code, I would say what I did particularly well was identifying what I need to write and how to get to the end result. While doing this, I could have enhanced my code and saw improvements by understanding how to utilize C++ in a better manner. The challenging part was trying to find out how to take the users input from whether it was a hour, minute, or second and displaying the accurate information for both displays in 12hrs and 24hrs. The resources I used to overcome this was by watching youtube videos on how to understand the subject matter deeper and I utilized some of my friends in the field to provide me help. The skills from this project that will transferable to other projects is just understand the structure from start to finish on how you want to tackle a particular task that you are working on. The way I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable was by utilizing the lessions we learned through the module and taking the time to write and figure out the problem at hand in order to get the end result.
